# Description

**FetchmeURLs** is a Powerful Recon Tool written by Chris 'SaintDruG' Abou-Chabk√© from Black Hat Ethical Hacking, designed for Bug Bounty Hunters to quickly fetch URLs for multiple domains as part of a small or large scope actively and passively. It uses **Waybackurls** and **GoBuster** to fetch URLs, combining both powers Active / Passive and then pipes the results after saving them into a new file probing each one using **httpx**. It will also display the status and progress such as how many URLs it found before and after the probing is done so that the user is aware what sort of attack vectors they can use after the Recon has been done.

### **Double Action: Passive and Active combined and Probed**

The idea is, you need to perform this once, then after you have the final URLs, you can use things like gf patterns from the URLs you fetched, to plan your next attack vectors. For examples you can use cariddi to find secrets, Nuclei on specific templates, Dalfox to find XSS Injection, SQLMap to find SQLi Injections, SSRF, Open Redirect or just manual exploration.

Recon is the most important part, if you want to one-line all that so you can then focus on the attack Vectors, this tool will help you do that accurately and does what it says it does.
